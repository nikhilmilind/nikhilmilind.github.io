The classic theory of mutation-selection balance predicts the equilibrium frequency of genetic
variation under negative selection. The model predicts a simple relationship between the total
frequency of deleterious variants, mutation rate, and strength of selection, with different
functions for recessive and (co-)dominant genes. In this study, we investigate whether genes
associated with human recessive disorders fit the predictions of this classic model. By comparing
observed frequencies of loss of function variants (LoFs) to those expected under mutation-selection
balance we find that, for nearly all recessive genes, the observed frequencies are too low to be
explained by purely recessive selection. Analyzing the effects of heterozygous LoFs on quantitative
traits from the UK Biobank, we find that recessive disease genes have widespread quantitative
effects in heterozygotes. Together, these results suggest that most selection experienced by
pathogenic mutations in recessive disease genes may be due to stabilizing selection in
heterozygotes. We conclude that very few human genes follow the classic model of recessive
mutation-selection balance.
