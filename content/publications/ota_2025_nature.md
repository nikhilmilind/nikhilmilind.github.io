Genetic association studies provide a unique tool for identifying candidate causal links from genes
to human traits and diseases. However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms
underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic
pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits. Here we propose approaches to bridge this gap
by combining quantitative estimates of gene–trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests
with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments in relevant cell types. By
combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional
associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological
programs or direct effects on the trait. As a proof of concept, we constructed a causal graph of
the gene-regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We
propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes
for traits, can bridge the gap between genetic association and biological mechanism.
