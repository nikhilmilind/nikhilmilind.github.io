## About Me

I am a PhD student in Jonathan Pritchard's lab at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in 
statistical and population genetics.

I have recently been thinking about the relationship between gene dosage and complex traits. We 
introduced the concept of the gene dosage response curve, which is a conceptual tool to think about
these relationships using population-level or experimental data.

I was previously a Master's student with [Emma Davenport](https://davenportlab.com/), where I worked
on using functional genomics to better understand sepsis. As an undergraduate student, I worked with
[David Aylor](https://aylorlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) on mouse quantitative genetics and
[Gregory Carter](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-carter-lab) on
statistical genetics approaches in Alzheimer's disease cohorts.
