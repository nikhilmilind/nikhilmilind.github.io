## About Me

I am a PhD student in
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html" target="_blank">Jonathan Pritchard</a>'s
lab at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in statistical and population genetics.

I have recently been thinking about the relationship between gene dosage and complex traits. We 
introduced the concept of the gene dosage response curve, which is a conceptual tool to think about
these relationships using population-level or experimental data.

I was previously a Master's student with
<a href="https://davenportlab.com/" target="_blank">Emma Davenport</a>, where I worked on using 
functional genomics to better understand sepsis. As an undergraduate student, I worked with
<a href="https://aylorlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">David Aylor</a> on mouse quantitative
genetics and
<a href="https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-carter-lab" target="_blank">Gregory Carter</a>
on statistical genetics approaches in Alzheimer's disease cohorts.
