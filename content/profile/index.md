## About Me

I am a PhD student in Jonathan Pritchard's lab at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in statistical and population genetics.

I was previously a Master's student with [Emma Davenport](https://davenportlab.com/), where I worked on using functional genomics to better understand sepsis. As an undergraduate student, I worked with [David Aylor](https://aylorlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) on mouse quantitative genetics and [Gregory Carter](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-carter-lab) on statistical genetics approaches in Alzheimer's disease cohorts.
